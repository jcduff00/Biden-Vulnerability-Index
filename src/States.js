              <p>
                New Hampshire has found itself at the center of infighting in the national Democratic Party. The state party has scorned Biden for his push to dethrone their first in the nation primary, and has refused to endorse his re-election. These voters also overwhelmingly rejected Biden in 2020, returning him a dismal fifth-place showing.

              <h3>Ohio</h3>
              <p>
                Ohio Democrats have recently been in a state of outrage over the Biden administration's slow response to the East Palestine train derailment. The state party has invited candidate Marianne Williamson to speak at their conference. Slow economic growth has hurt the state's labor unions, a major fixture of the state Democratic machine. A coup may be forming.

              <h3>Iowa</h3>
              <p>
                Following technology failures in the 2020 Iowa caucuses, the state has found itself relegated to the background of the 2024 primary calendar. The forced removal of this tradition places Iowa at the heart of a potential anti-Biden rebellion in the party. High inflation has hurt Farmer Democrats in particular, a key constituency in this state.

              <h3>California</h3>
              <p>
                California was one of the few states to reject Biden's candidacy in 2020, opting to overwhelmingly support Bernie Sanders instead. California's Democratic electorate is disproportionately young, and the state has found itself plagued by a major housing crisis under the Biden administration.

               Utah voters are by far the youngest in the nation, with almost 4 in 10 voters being from the Gen Z age cohort. This state's Democrats backed leftwing alternatives in both 2016 and 2020. These variables make Utah fertile ground for a progressive challenger to pull off an unprecedented upset.

              <p>
                Vermont is the beating heart of the progressive movement in the United States. The state party is controlled by leftwing activists, who may be likely to throw their resources behind an alternative candidate. These abstract conditions make Vermont a special case in modern American politics, and perhaps a key player in a partisan rebellion.
